# Udemy's Applied Control System I by Mark Misin Engineering

This repository houses my solutions for projects completed as part of Udemy's Applied Control System I course. 

## Projects

### Modeling and Control of Water Tank Level

The mathematical model of a water tank was created using python. Then, a P-controller is used to achieve the desired reference volume level of the water tank.
